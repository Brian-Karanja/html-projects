<p><h1> How Esri geodatabase handles spatial attribute data. </h1>
Esri geodatabase is usually assumed to be a container for spatial and attribute data. The “geo” part of it relates it with spatial part or the location.
To store the attribute and spatial data in the geodatabase, one would open a new file geodatabase where he will specify the type of object that should be indicated as well as their    type format I.e. either point line or polygon feature. If an object is subdivided in a hierarchical manner, then the option that suit the situation is applied let’s say “feature dataset or feature classes are made.”
Sql (sequential query language) is used for query the esri geodatabase, and it includes the relational and logical operators” </p>


<p><h1><a name="oracle"></a> 2. ORACLE SPATIAL 10g </h1>
Oracle spatial, forms a separately-licensed option component of the Oracle Database. Oracle database is an object-relational database management system produced and market by oracle co-operation.
The spatial features in oracle spatial and graph aid users in managing geographic and location-data in a native type with an oracle database potentially supporting a wide range of application from automated mapping facilities management and GIS (geographic information System) to wireless location services and location enabled e-business.
The Oracle feature in Oracle Spatial include network data model graphs used in traditional network application in major transportation utilities and energy transportation.
The geospatial feature in Oracle spatial provides a SQL Schema and functions that facilitate the storage, retrial update and query of collectors of spatial feature in an oracle database.
Geospatial feature handled by Oracle spatial includes
-	A schema that prescribe the storage syntax and semantics of supported geometric data types.
-	A spatial indexing system.
-	Operators function and procedure for performing area-of-interest queries, spatial join queries and other spatial analysis operations.
-	Functions and procedures and other spatial analysis operation.
-	A topological data model for working with data about nodes, edges and faces in a topology. </p>


<p><h1> STORING SPATIAL DATA </h1>
In Oracle spatial information is specified using two components. A location with respect to some origin on a geometric shape. In this case location is treated as spatial data while shape is the attribute data.
As for location it specifies where the data is located with respect to a two, three or four-dimension co-ordinate space, for example the center of nyeri is located at coordinate (-0.397742, 36.961262) in the 2D “lat, long” space.
The shape on the other side specifies the geometric structure of the data. Point, line and polygon are examples of possible shapes. For instance, the center of san Francisco is located at co-ordinate (-1220436, -370719) in the @D “lat, long” space and is a point shape.</p>

<h2>-PARENTS TALKING TO THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT DRUGS</h2>
Just as parents protect their kids against illness like muscles they can as well protect them against drug abuse which may involve sharing of needles, uncontrolled sex desire that may lead to infections of HIV and aids. Kids who don’t feel comfortable taking to their parents have a great risk of acquiring aid since they may tend to seek information from unreliable sources that may put them at a greater risk of engaging in unsafe behavior and experimenting with drugs.<p>

<p><h2>-PARENTS TAKING TO THEIR CHILDREN ABOUT SEX.</h2>
When parents become open to their children about sex the children will definitely know the effect  of fornication and the spread on hiv on children. If the parents fail to do that part the kid will engage in to immoral activities due to the engagement in pornographic materials hence increase the risk of acquiring hiv.</p>

<p><a name=" hiv"></a><h2>-REVEALING THE TRUTH ABOUT HIV AND HOW IT SPREAD.</h2>
Parents should reveal to their kids what hiv is and how it is contracted. This should be done so that so that the kids may be able to protect themselves against hiv virus by avoiding sharing sharp objects as well as touching open wounds with bare hands or blood which may lead to the transmission of hiv virus. By doing si they will be reducing the level of hiv spread in the whole country.</p>

<p><h2>PARENTS SHOULD BE FREE TO THE CHILDREN ABOUT THE USE OF CONTRACEPTIVES</h2>
Advices from parents are one the best advices children will ever get especially when the are in the stage of adolescence. When the parents become open to their children they will definitely understand the experinces which their children face. With the idea at hand they should be free to speak about the use of contraceptives especially condoms. This will highly reduce the spread of hiv in the whole country if  it is done in a perfect manner.</p>

 <p><a name="children are"></a><h2>PARENTS SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEIR CHILREN TO BE FREE   SHARING THEIR OWN EXPERINCES CONCERNING THEIR RELATIONSHIPS.</h2>
Children in the family can also participate in reducing the spread of hiv and aids in the country. This can only happen when they all become free with one another and always ready to share their own experinces about their relationships with the boy/girl friend. By doing so with the help of the mature  ones especially the first borns they will discourage some activities which may involve  engagement in fornication  thus reducing the the spread of hiv in Kenya.</p>
