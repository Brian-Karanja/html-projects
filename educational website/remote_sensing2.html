<p><h2><u><dfn>WHAT IS REMOTESENSING?</dfn></u></h2></p>
So, what exactly is remote sensing? For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the
following definition:
<b>"Remote sensing is the science (and to some extent, art) of acquiring
information about the Earth's surface without actually being in contact
with it. This is done by sensing and recording reflected or emitted energy
and processing, analyzing, and applying that information."</b>
<p>In much of remote sensing, the process involves an interaction between incident radiation
and the targets of interest. This is exemplified by the use of imaging systems where the
following seven elements are involved. Note, however that remote sensing also involves the
sensing of emitted energy and the use of non-imaging sensors.</p>

<a name="1"></a><h2><u>Interactions with the Atmosphere</u></h2>

<p>Before radiation used for remote sensing reaches the Earth's surface it has to travel through
some distance of the Earth's atmosphere. Particles and gases in the atmosphere can affect
the incoming light and radiation. These effects are caused by the mechanisms of scattering
and absorption.</p>

<p><em>Scattering</em> occurs when particles or large gas molecules present in the atmosphere interact
with and cause the electromagnetic radiation to be redirected from its original path. How much
scattering takes place depends on several factors including the wavelength of the radiation,
the abundance of particles or gases, and the distance the radiation travels through the
atmosphere.</p>

<h2><u>There are three (3) types of scattering which take place.</u></h2>
<ol>
<a name="2"></a><li><h3><u> Rayleigh scattering</u></h3></li>

<p><strong>Rayleigh scattering</strong> occurs when particles are very small compared to the wavelength of the
radiation. These could be particles such as small specks of dust or nitrogen and oxygen
molecules. Rayleigh scattering causes shorter wavelengths of energy to be scattered much
more than longer wavelengths.<br> Rayleigh scattering is the dominant scattering mechanism in
the upper atmosphere. The fact that the sky appears "blue" during the day is because of this
phenomenon. As sunlight passes through the atmosphere, the shorter wavelengths (i.e. blue)
of the visible spectrum are scattered more than the other (longer) visible wavelengths.<br> At
sunrise and sunset the light has to travel farther through the atmosphere than at midday and
the scattering of the shorter wavelengths is more complete; this leaves a greater proportion of
the longer wavelengths to penetrate the atmosphere.</p>

<a name="3"></a><li><h3><u> Mie scattering</u></h3></li>

<p><strong>Mie scattering</strong> occurs when the particles are just about the same size as the wavelength of
the radiation. Dust, pollen, smoke and water vapour are common causes of Mie scattering
which tends to affect longer wavelengths than those affected by Rayleigh scattering. Mie
scattering occurs mostly in the lower portions of the atmosphere where larger particles are
more abundant, and dominates when cloud conditions are overcast.</p>

<a name="4"></a><li><h3><u> Nonselective scattering</u></h3></li>

<p>The final scattering mechanism of importance is
called <strong>nonselective scattering</strong>. This occurs when
the particles are much larger than the wavelength of
the radiation. Water droplets and large dust
particles can cause this type of scattering.<br>
Nonselective scattering gets its name from the fact
that all wavelengths are scattered about equally.<br>
This type of scattering causes fog and clouds to
appear white to our eyes because blue, green, and
red light are all scattered in approximately equal
quantities (blue+green+red light = white light).

<a name="5"></a><h2><u>Absorption</u></h2>

<p><strong>Absorption</strong> is the other main mechanism at work
when electromagnetic radiation interacts with the
atmosphere. In contrast to scattering, this
phenomenon causes molecules in the atmosphere to
absorb energy at various wavelengths. Ozone,
carbon dioxide, and water vapour are the three main
atmospheric constituents which absorb radiation.</p>

<a name="6"></a><h2><u>Ozone</u></h2>

<p><strong>Ozone</strong> serves to absorb the harmful (to most living
things) ultraviolet radiation from the sun. Without this
protective layer in the atmosphere our skin would
burn when exposed to sunlight.</p>

<a name="7"></a><h2><u>Carbon Dioxide</u></h2>

<p>You may have heard carbon dioxide referred to as
a greenhouse gas. This is because it tends to absorb radiation strongly in the far infrared
portion of the spectrum - that area associated with thermal heating - which serves to trap this
heat inside the atmosphere. Water vapour in the atmosphere absorbs much of the incoming
longwave infrared and shortwave microwave radiation (between 22μm and 1m). The
presence of water vapour in the lower atmosphere varies greatly from location to location and
at different times of the year. For example, the air mass above a desert would have very little
water vapour to absorb energy, while the tropics would have high concentrations of water
vapour (i.e. high humidity).</p>

<p>Because these gases absorb
electromagnetic energy in very
specific regions of the spectrum, they
influence where (in the spectrum) we
can "look" for remote sensing
purposes. Those areas of the
spectrum which are not severely
influenced by atmospheric absorption
and thus, are useful to remote
sensors, are called atmospheric
windows. By comparing the
characteristics of the two most
common energy/radiation sources
(the sun and the earth) with the
atmospheric windows available to us, we can define those wavelengths that we can
use most effectively for remote sensing. The visible portion of the spectrum, to
which our eyes are most sensitive, corresponds to both an atmospheric window and
the peak energy level of the sun. Note also that heat energy emitted by the Earth
corresponds to a window around 10 μm in the thermal IR portion of the spectrum,
while the large window at wavelengths beyond 1 mm is associated with the
