<i>This one has answers:</i>
<ol>
   <li><strong>Discuss the challenges facing the adoption of water harvesting technologies in Kenya [5 marks]</strong></li>
     <ul>
         <li>Water Supply and Consumption Levels. Depending on climate and workload, the human body needs about 3-10 litres of water per day. The amount and purpose varies widely, and is greatly influenced by the type and availability of the water supply. In rainwater harvesting large surface areas (catchments) and the storage tank is required to provide sufficient supply for the dry seasons.</li>
         <li>Policy Issues. In many instances community based organisations, non-governmental organisations, government departments and even some donor agencies lack policy guidelines in support of rainwater harvesting.</li>
	     <li>Technical Issues. No matter how well designed a rainwater harvesting system, if it is not technically efficient, it will not deliver or perform the anticipated functions. Many projects, particularly in the rural areas, are not sustainable or cannot be replicable due to inadequate technical interventions, e.g. construction of roof catchment system, shallow wells and tanks.</li>
         <li>Managerial Issues. There is a sense of ownership, community participation and contribution in the management of community based water projects unlike in the government projects where the water managers have little or no enthusiasm in the management affairs.</li>
         <li>Population growth. There is high potential of rainwater harvesting both in rural and developing urban centres particularly in countries like Kenya due to the rapid population growth and the need for alternative water sources that are simple, effective, low cost and environmentally sound.</li>
         <li>Lack of suitable training programmes in rainwater harvesting. A large number of Kenyans fails to understand the water harvesting methodologies including other related operation such as repair simply because they are illiterate. Different programmes should be put up to equip people with the knowledge of water harvesting. </li>
      </ul>

   <li><strong>Discuss the challenges facing irrigation practice in Kenya. [5 marks]</strong></li>
      <ul>
         <li>Fall of water table. A possible advantage of reducing the water table level prior to the rainy season is that it may increase the potential for groundwater recharge. Lowering the water table by the provision of drainage to irrigation schemes  with high water tables brings benefits to agriculture.</li>
         <li>Solute dispersion. The changing hydrological regime associated with irrigation schemes may alter the capacity of the environment to assimilate water soluble pollution. In particular, reductions in low flows result in increased pollutant concentrations already discharged into the water course either from point sources, such as industry, irrigation drains and urban areas, or from non-point sources, such as agrochemicals leaking into groundwater and soil erosion.</li>
         <li>Agrochemical pollution. A high nutrient level is essential for productive agriculture. However, the use of both natural and chemical fertilizers may result in an excess of nutrients which can cause problems in water bodies and to health. Nitrates are highly soluble and therefore may quickly reach water bodies. Phosphates tend to be fixed to soil particles and therefore reach water courses when soil is eroded.</li>
         <li>Local erosion. The method of irrigation profoundly affects the vulnerability of the land to erosion. Because irrigated land is wetter, it is less able to absorb rainfall and runoff will therefore be higher. Field size, stream size (drop size), slope and field layout are all difficult to change and all significantly affect erosion rates. Careful design can avoid the occurrence of erosion problems. Agricultural practices affect soil structure and therefore the soil's erosivity, or the ease with which particles are dislodged.</li>
         <li>Income and amenity. Insufficient external supports such as markets, agro-chemical inputs, extension and credit facilities. Changing labor patterns that make labour-intensive irrigation unattractive.</li>
         <li>Human migration. Human migration (outside of the nomadic way of life) and displacement are commensurate with a breakdown in community infrastructure which results in a degree of social unrest and may contribute to malnutrition and an increased incidence of disease. Large, new irrigation schemes attract temporary populations both during construction and during peak periods of agricultural labour demands and provision for their accommodation needs to be anticipated.</li>
         <li>Resettlement. Often the most significant social issue arising from irrigation development is resettlement of people displaced by the flooding of land and homes or the construction of canals or other works. This can be particularly disruptive to communities and, in the past, insensitive project development has caused unnecessary problems by a lack of consultation at the planning stage and inadequate compensation of the affected population.</li>
       </ul>
   <li><strong>Describe the use of GIS and Remote Sensing in monitoring land use change as an integral part of watershed management. [5 marks]</strong></li>
       <ul>
          <li>To rehabilitate the deteriorating land. Remote sensing provides real time and a sequence of previous imageries which enable in identifying regions 
           which have deteriorated over time.</li>
  	      <li>To moderate the flood peaks at downstream areas. Different data of the same location are obtained using remote sensing and a comparison within the  sequence of the data done using GIS analysis tool to detect the changes which aids watershed management bodies to moderate the peaks appropriately.</li>
          <li>To control damaging runoff and degradation. Runoff and degradation of runoff is identified  using change detection concept where different imagery from different time are analysed using GIS software and the change being detected.</li>
          <li>To improve the land of watershed for efficient and sustained production. Remote sensing imagery is used in identifying less efficient watersheds and new designs are provided using the GIS software which results in a more appropriate and efficient watershed.</li>
          <li>To check soil erosion. Change detection in remote sensing and GIS identify regions where soil erosion along the watersheds occurs and appropriate measures are employed by the watersheds management’s board. Both GIS and remote sensing aids in the boards operation thus less economic as compared to manual method of accessing the watersheds from the ground.</li> 
       </ul>
    <li><strong>Discuss factors that affect wastewater re-use and Describe any FOUR ways of direct and indirect wastewater re-use. [10 marks]</strong></li>
