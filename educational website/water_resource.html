<h2><u>THE ROLE OF GEOMATIC ENGINEER</u></h2>

<h3><u><em>ENGINEEER IN INTERGRATED WATER RESOURCE
MANAGEMENT.</em></u></h3> 

<p><strong>Geomatics engineer</strong> makes
explorations and carries out ground water
resource assessment projects to quantify and
develop water resource or an area.<br> The
assessment involves use of remote sensing data,
geological mapping, deep well drilling and aquifer
testing, surface and borehole geophysics. Data is
used to develop regional ground water flow and
hydrological chemical evolution models.</p>

<p>The models are used to quantify the resource the
resource and develop a ground water
management program for the deep aquifers.<br>
Geomatic engineers use the Landsat-TM imagery
to generate basemaps and initial surface
hydrological interpretations. Field trothing and
point sampling data from wells, springs and other
features are positioned using the hand held GPS.
</p>
<b>Aquifers test, drilling and seismic survey data are
then combined with GIS MAPINFO system to
create composite hydrogeological maps of target
aquifers over project area. </b>
<p>The hydrological mapsbring basic 
geological information together with
data on the hydraulic and hydro-chemical
characteristics of the rocks and their usefulness
for groundwater supply. <br>Geomatics combine
remote sensing, GPS and GIS technologies to
come up with powerful platform for storing,
standardizing, analyzing and presenting a wide
variety of hydrological data coverage a large and
remote area.</p>
 <p><strong>Geomatics engineer </strong> uses GIS
coupled with system that serves as a geodata
management and preprocessing unit for the
hydrological process model.<br> GIS is also used as a
post processing component, integrating the
various model results and visualizing them.
Geomatic engineer uses remote sensing data to
provide hydrological relevant.</p>
 <p>Remote sensing can
supply input and validation data for hydrological
models and concentrate on water balance and
water demand. Modeling hydrology and social,
economic and land use development allows the
prediction of water demand and availability.</p>
