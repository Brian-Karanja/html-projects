So, what exactly is remote sensing? For the purposes of this tutorial, we will use the
following definition:
<b>"Remote sensing is the science (and to some extent, art) of acquiring
information about the Earth's surface without actually being in contact
with it. This is done by sensing and recording reflected or emitted energy
and processing, analyzing, and applying that information."</b>
<p>rererer</p>
<b>In much of remote sensing, the process involves an interaction between incident radiation
and the targets of interest. This is exemplified by the use of imaging systems where the
following seven elements are involved. Note, however that remote sensing also involves the
sensing of emitted energy and the use of non-imaging sensors.</b>
